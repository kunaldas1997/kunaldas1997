- 👋 Hi, I’m @kunaldas1997
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Development, Web Development adn Android App Development

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any game that help me gain major experience so that I can apply for the job
- 📫 How to reach me -> email me at kunaldas1107@gmail.com
- **Tip for interview panels (in case they read it)** - At any point of time, you think I am not eligible, even its mid interview, I strongly suggest you to tell me that if I am going to next round or not. Because I don't want false hope from words such as "We will get back to you" and shit. No matter whatever reputed company you are, just be straight with me the very moment you feel I lack anything. I will leave the panel in silence without any question.
